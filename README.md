## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
normaIyad** is a âœ¨ special front end devedeveloper âœ¨ 
As a passionate Front-End Developer, I specialize in creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap, I thrive on transforming ideas into functional, interactive, and responsive designs.
I have hands-on experience building projects such as an e-commerce platform, movie search app, and a portfolio template, which showcase my ability to deliver innovative solutions. My internship at The Civil Society for the Blind in Jerusalem allowed me to refine my technical troubleshooting and problem-solving skills in real-world environments.
Beyond my technical skills, I value teamwork, adaptability, and effective communication. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and continuously improving my craft. Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge through courses in React and ASP.NET to grow as a full-stack developer.
